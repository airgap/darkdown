# Snarkdown
For basic info on this project, read my [blog post](https://www.dmb.dev/snarkdown/).

To test this out:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

If that doesn't work, `npm i typescript`. This project currently executes with ts-node, but I plan on switching to [Deno](https://deno.land) in the long run to benefit from its massive performance and security advantages.
